# Demo-2 outcomes

## Last minute changes and starting on time

*Need to introduce a code freeze in the morning of a Demo Day.*

*Need to introduce "stable" label and feature branches.*

The code was not ready after merge, the team fixed last minute issues until the very show time

---

*Prepare your equipment beforehand*

People gathered on time, yet it took the team almost 20 minutes to prepare the show.

Checklist:

  - computer is attached to projector
  - teamviewer or anothe rbroadcasting is running
  - recording equipment is ready
  - fellows and gals are ready to deliver


## Delivery

*Need to change the presenting approach.*

Now it's UI elements overview and showing some meaningless code.

*Expected:*  For the overview - Define the challenges, and provide the ways to address them with our product.

*Consider:* letting 1-2 people talk and 1-2 assist with computer

*For insight:* prepare overall diagrams to illustrate general concepts. Prepare interactive examples to illustrate details.

pictures! People prefer pictures rather than text, stories rather than obvious facts.


## Functionality and code

Payment (taking their money) is among our main functions. Why we did not take it into account when developed the system? What are our steps towards having it implemented?

To solve: import existing data when deploying.

Fixit: Debug code does not go to main repository.

Log messages are ok, we love them. They just need to be informative.

Validation on server FIRST. Then - client. We do not want to be hacked.


## History

Try to remember the history of the project by checkin messages.

The messages should be meaningful. Together they should represent a coherent story.
